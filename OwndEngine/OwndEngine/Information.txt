 Install SDL
	- Download SDL devel
	- paste into deps
	- put stuff from include folder into deps/include
	- put stuff from lib x86 (NEED TO RESEARCH PORTING TO DIFFERENT PROCESSORS)
		x86 -> 32 bit processor
		x64 -> 64 bit processor
		 folder into deps/lib/Release and deps/lib/Debug
	- Only need to keep the include dlls, SDL2.lib and SDL2main.lib
	- Need the to put SDL2.dll in the $(SolutionDir)Debug|$(SolutionDir)Release thing
 Install GLEW
	- GLEW is an extension wrangler library thing (it handles extensions)
	- Needs glew32.lib, the other lib is the static library
		- needs glew32 dll also putting that in the debug/release solution dir thing
	- Put the GL in the deps/include/ folder
 Install GLM
	- Copy the inner glm folder (the one with all the header stuff) in the deps/include glm folder
